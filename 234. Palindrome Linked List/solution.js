/* 
Approach Summary

    The solution converts the linked list into a string by traversing the list and appending each node's value to the string. This is done using a while loop that continues until the end of the list is reached.
    Once the string representation of the list is obtained, the function checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. This is done by splitting the string into an array of characters, reversing the array, and then joining the characters back into a string.
    If the original string and its reverse are identical, the function returns true, indicating that the linked list is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns false.

Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because each node in the list is visited once to construct the string representation of the list.
    
    Space Complexity: The space complexity is also O(n), as the string representation of the list requires space proportional to the number of nodes in the list.
