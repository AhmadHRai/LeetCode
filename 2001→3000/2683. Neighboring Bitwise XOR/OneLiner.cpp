/*
Approach Summary:
The function checks if a valid array can be constructed from the given `derived` array. It does this by calculating the sum of all elements in the `derived` array using the `accumulate` function from the `<numeric>` library. If the total sum is even, it indicates that a valid configuration exists; otherwise, it does not.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `derived` array. The function iterates through the entire array once to compute the sum.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional data structures are used that scale with input size; only a fixed number of variables are utilized.
