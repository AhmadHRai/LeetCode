    /*
    Approach Summary:
        This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to build the smallest number that matches the given pattern. It iteratively appends digits to the result 
        string based on whether the pattern character is 'I' (increment) or 'D' (decrement).
    
        However, the provided solution seems incomplete and may not correctly implement the logic for generating the smallest number based on the pattern. A typical 
        approach would involve using a stack or similar data structure to manage the digits based on the pattern.
    
    Complexity Analysis:
    - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the pattern, because each character in the pattern is processed once.
    - Space Complexity: O(N), for storing the recursion stack and the result string.
