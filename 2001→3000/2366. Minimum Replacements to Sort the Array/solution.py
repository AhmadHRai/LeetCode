Approach:
    - Initialization: The function initializes variables to track the number of operations (`ans`) and the current element for comparison (`last`).
    
    - Traverse Array in Reverse: Starting from the second last element to the first element (`n-2` to `0`), the function compares each element with `last`.
    
    - Replacement Condition: If the current element is greater than `last`, calculate how many times `last` needs to be divided to make the current element less than or equal to `last`. Update `last` accordingly and increment `ans` by `(t - 1)` for the number of operations performed.
    
    - No Replacement: If the current element does not need replacement (`nums[i] <= last`), update `last` without any operations.
    
Complexity:
    - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. The function iterates through the array once, performing constant-time operations in each iteration.
    
    - Space Complexity: O(1). The function uses only a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
