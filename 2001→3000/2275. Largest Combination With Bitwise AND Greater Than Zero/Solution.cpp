/*
Approach Summary:
- The problem asks for the largest combination of elements in the input array `candidates` that share the same bit at the same position in their binary representation.
- We iterate over each of the 24 possible bit positions (since integers are typically 32 bits, but here we limit to 24 bits, which is more than enough for typical cases).
- For each bit position `i`, we check all the integers in the array `candidates` to see if the `i`-th bit is set (`a >> i & 1` checks if the i-th bit is 1).
- For every number that has the `i`-th bit set, we increment the count `cur`. We then update the result `res` to be the maximum of the current result and the count `cur`.
- At the end of the process, `res` contains the largest number of elements in the array that share the same bit set at a particular position.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n * b), where `n` is the number of elements in the `candidates` array and `b` is the number of bit positions we check (in this case, 24). For each bit position, we check all the elements in the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space for variables (`res`, `cur`, `i`, etc.) regardless of the input size.
