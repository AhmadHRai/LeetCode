""" Solution Approach:
The given solution approach uses a Counter object to count how many valid moves Alice can make and how many valid moves Bob can make. It iterates through the input string colors to count these moves.

    The collections.Counter() is used to count the occurrences of characters in the string.
    The groupby(colors) function groups consecutive characters in the string.
    It iterates through the groups and counts how many 'A's and 'B's can be removed according to the game rules. Specifically, it counts the number of 'A's and 'B's that have at least two neighbors of the same color.
    Finally, it compares the counts of valid moves for Alice ('A') and Bob ('B'). If Alice has more valid moves, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The idea is that if Alice can make more valid moves than Bob, she has a winning strategy because she will eventually force Bob into a position where he can't make a move.
This solution works under the assumption that both players play optimally and is a good approach to solve the problem efficiently. """
