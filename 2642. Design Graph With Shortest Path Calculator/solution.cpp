/* 
The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n \log n), where m is the number of edges and n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because the constructor and the addEdge 
function loop through the edges vector once and perform constant time operations in each iteration, which is O(m). The shortestPath function uses a priority queue to perform a 
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which takes O(m + n \log n) time in the worst case, as each edge is visited once and each node is extracted from the priority queue once.

The space complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the number of edges and n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is because the solution uses an adjacency list to 
store the graph, which takes O(m + n) space, a priority queue to store the nodes and their distances, which takes O(n) space in the worst case, and a vector to store the shortest 
distances, which takes O(n) space.
