## About

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by problem number and name. I believe in clean and well-documented code, so each solution is accompanied by an explanation of the approach used and the reasoning behind it. This repository is not just about solving problems, but also about learning and improving.

## Usage

You can navigate through the different problems by browsing the directories. Each problem's directory includes:

- The solution(s) in various programming languages (Python, Java, etc.)
- A detailed explanation of the approach
- Complexity analysis
- Any relevant notes or gotchas

Feel free to explore, learn from the solutions, and provide feedback. If you find a better approach or a mistake in any of the solutions, I'd love to hear about it.
