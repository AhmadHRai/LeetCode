/*
Approach:
1. **Sorting Friends by Arrival Times**:
   - We first create an `order` vector to store indices of friends, which we sort based on arrival times (`times[i][0]`). This way, we can handle friends in the sequence they arrive.

2. **Tracking Available and Occupied Chairs**:
   - We use two priority queues:
     - `emptySeats`: a min-heap to track available chairs in ascending order. Each chair has an index from `0` to `n-1`.
     - `takenSeats`: a min-heap to track occupied chairs with pairs of leave times and chair indices. It helps free up chairs when a friend leaves.

3. **Assigning Chairs**:
   - For each friend:
     - Free up chairs for any friends who have left by the current friend's arrival time (based on `takenSeats`).
     - Assign the smallest available chair (from `emptySeats`) to the current friend.
     - If the current friend is the `targetFriend`, return the chair index immediately.
     - Otherwise, push the friendâ€™s leave time and chair index into `takenSeats` to mark the chair as occupied until they leave.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If the `targetFriend` is not found, return `-1`, though this is unlikely under normal conditions.

Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of friends. Sorting takes `O(n log n)`, and each heap operation for `emptySeats` and `takenSeats` takes `O(log n)`, resulting in an overall complexity of `O(n log n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store `n` indices in the `order` vector and use two priority queues with a maximum of `n` elements.
