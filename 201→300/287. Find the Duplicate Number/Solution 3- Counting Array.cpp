/* 
Approach Summary:
    This solution uses a counting array to find the duplicate number. It iterates through the array, incrementing the count of each number in the counting array. If a number is encountered that has already been counted, it is the duplicate number.

Complexity Analysis:
    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is visited once.
    Space Complexity: O(n), as the solution uses an additional array to store the counts of the numbers in the array.

Note: This solution was scored the best by the judge, indicating its efficiency and simplicity in solving the problem.
