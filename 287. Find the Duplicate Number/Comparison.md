## Comparison of Solutions

### Solution 1: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm

- **Efficiency**: Efficient in terms of time complexity, using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which finds the duplicate in O(n) time.
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of pointers and the algorithm.

### Solution 2: Binary Search

- **Efficiency**: More intuitive but has a higher time complexity of O(n log n) due to the counting of elements in each iteration.
- **Complexity**: Uses a binary search approach, which is more intuitive but less efficient in terms of time complexity.

### Solution 3: Counting Array

- **Efficiency**: Despite having a higher space complexity, was scored the best by the judge, indicating its efficiency and simplicity in solving the problem.
- **Complexity**: It is the most straightforward and easy to understand, especially for those not familiar with pointers or binary search.

### Conclusion

- **Solution 1** is the most efficient in terms of time complexity but requires a deeper understanding of pointers and the algorithm.
- **Solution 2** is more intuitive but less efficient due to its higher time complexity.
- **Solution 3**, despite its higher space complexity, was the best-scored solution by the judge, highlighting its efficiency and simplicity.
