Explanation:

    This solution utilizes backtracking to generate all possible partitions of the given string s where each partition contains only palindromic substrings.
    The partition function serves as a wrapper function that initializes necessary variables and calls the recursive helper function partitionHelper to perform the actual 
    partitioning.
    
    In the partitionHelper function:
        We start with a base case: if the start index reaches the end of the string s, we have found a valid partition, so we add the current partition to the list of 
            partitions.
        Otherwise, we iterate over all possible substrings starting from the start index.
        For each substring, we check if it's a palindrome using the isPalindrome function. If it is, we add it to the current partition, recurse for the remaining string, 
            and backtrack by removing the last added substring to explore other possibilities.
    The isPalindrome function checks if a given substring of s is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends towards the middle.

Complexity Analysis:
    Time Complexity:
        The time complexity of this solution depends on the number of partitions generated.
        In the worst case, if there are no palindromic substrings, the algorithm will generate all possible partitions, which is O(2^N), where NN is the length of the input string.
        However, due to backtracking, not all possible partitions are explored, resulting in a lower time complexity in practical cases.
        Checking if a substring is a palindrome takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the substring.

    Space Complexity:
        The space complexity is dominated by the recursion stack.
        In the worst case, the recursion stack can grow up to O(N), where NN is the length of the input string.
        Additionally, the space complexity includes the space used by the partitions vector, which can hold up to O(2^N) partitions.
        Overall, the space complexity is O(Nâ‹…2^N).
