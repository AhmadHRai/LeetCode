/* 
    Purpose: 
        The function equalSubstring aims to find the length of the longest substring where the transformation cost (difference between characters in strings s and t) 
        does not exceed a given threshold k.

    Approach:
        Sliding Window Technique: Use two pointers (i and j) to represent the current substring. Move j to expand the window and adjust i to shrink it when the cost exceeds k.
        Cost Calculation: Calculate the transformation cost as abs(s[j] - t[j]) and adjust k accordingly.
        Tracking Length: Track the length of valid substrings (j - i) and return the maximum length found.

    Complexity:
        Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity, where n is the length of strings s and t.
        Space Complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity, regardless of the input size.
