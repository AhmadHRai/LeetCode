/*
Approach:
1. Use a Max-Heap to Maintain Character Counts:
   - Initialize a max-heap (`priority_queue`) to keep track of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' along with their counts, prioritized by the highest count.
   - Each character and its count are pushed only if its count is greater than 0.

2. Build the Result String While Avoiding Consecutive Repetition:
   - Retrieve the character with the highest count, `char1`, and check the last two characters in `result` to avoid forming three consecutive identical characters.
   - If adding `char1` creates a sequence of three identical characters, add the second-most frequent character instead (obtained from the heap) and adjust its count.
   - Reinsert characters with remaining counts back into the heap to maintain order.

3. Continue Until No More Characters Can be Added:
   - The loop stops if no alternative characters are available, or if the max-heap is exhausted.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O((a + b + c) * log 3) â‰ˆ O(a + b + c), since each operation in the heap has O(log 3) complexity (with at most three elements in the heap).
- Space Complexity: O(1), as only a few variables and a fixed-size max-heap are used.
