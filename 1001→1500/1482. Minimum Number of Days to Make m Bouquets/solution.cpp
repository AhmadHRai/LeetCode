Approach Summary:

To determine the minimum number of days required to bloom flowers such that m bouquets of k flowers each can be made, the solution employs binary search on the possible bloom days. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Initial Check**: Ensures feasibility by checking if `(m * k)` is less than or equal to the total number of flowers (`n`). If not, it's impossible to form the required bouquets, hence returns `-1`.

2. **Binary Search**: Searches between the minimum and maximum bloom days (`mini` and `maxi`). For each middle day (`mid`), it checks if it's possible to form `m` bouquets of `k` flowers using the `possible` function.

3. **Feasibility Check (`possible` function)**: Counts how many flowers can be included within `day` days. It calculates the number of bouquets that can be formed from these flowers and checks if it meets or exceeds `m`.

4. **Adjustment**: Adjusts the search range (`low` and `high`) based on whether forming `m` bouquets of `k` flowers was possible with `mid` days.

5. **Result**: Returns the minimum number of days (`low`) found where it's possible to form the required bouquets.

Time Complexity:
- `minDays` function: O(n log(maxi - mini)), where `n` is the size of `bloomDay`.
- `possible` function: O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1) additional space.
