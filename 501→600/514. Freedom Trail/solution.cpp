/* 
Approach:

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of steps to rotate the ring to match the key. The steps include rotating the ring and pressing the 
button.

    1. Initialize an array of vectors to store the positions of each character in the ring.
    2. Populate this array by iterating through the ring and storing the index of each character.
    3. Initialize two vectors for dynamic programming: `pre` for the previous state and `cur` for the current state.
    4. Iterate through the key in reverse order. For each character in the key, calculate the minimum number of steps to rotate the ring to match this character by 
        considering all possible positions of this character in the ring.
    5. Update the current state with the minimum number of steps found.
    6. Swap the current and previous state vectors for the next iteration and reset the current state vector.
    7. After iterating through the entire key, return the minimum number of steps to match the entire key, plus the number of characters in the key (since each character 
        press is considered a step).

Complexity:

    Time Complexity: O(n*m), where n is the length of the ring and m is the length of the key. This is because for each character in the key, we potentially check all positions of this character in the ring.

    Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the ring. This is due to the storage required for the dynamic programming vectors and the positions array.

This approach is efficient for solving the problem within the given constraints, as it systematically explores all possible rotations of the ring to match the key with 
the minimum number of steps.
